# HandsOn - Community-Driven Social Volunteering Platform

## ðŸ“Œ 1. Project Overview

HandsOn is a community-driven social volunteering platform designed to connect individuals with meaningful social impact opportunities. Users can discover and join volunteer-driven events, post requests for community help, form teams for large-scale initiatives, and track their contributions. The platform encourages social responsibility, collaboration, and proactive engagement in volunteer work, rewarding participants with a point-based system and recognition through certificates.

Think of it as a "GitHub for social work," where people contribute their time instead of code, building real-world impact together.
